# Leetcode-Solutions
It contains leetcode solutions as I was solving questions on leetcode I used to upload it here to track my consistency with both leetcode and github

This repository is dedicated to tracking my daily LeetCode problem-solving journey. It contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems I encounter on LeetCode. By maintaining this repo, I aim to:

Track Consistency: Ensure daily problem-solving consistency.
Review & Revise: Have an easily accessible collection of past solutions for revision.
Improve Problem-Solving Skills: Keep track of logic and approaches used to solve problems over time.
Structure
The repository is organized by problem categories and difficulty levels:

Categories: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, etc.
Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard.
Each solution includes:

Problem statement (brief summary).
Approach/logic used.
Optimized solutions (if applicable).
